#We want you to attempt and submit a solution for the challenge exercise. It's okay if the solution isn't correct (the problem is quite difficult), 
#but it's important to try such difficult problems to stretch your brain!

#Have the user enter 10 words, and allow for duplicate words. After the user is done, the program will tell the user which word was entered the most frequently.

#For example, if the user enters:

#apple, banana, orange, pear, apple, pear, apple, squash, apple, pear

#The program will say:

#apple was your most common word
#(That's because apple appeared in the user's list 4 times, more than any other word.)

#HINT: USE A HASH TO KEEP TRACK OF HOW MANY TIMES EACH WORD APPEARS IN THE LIST.
