<head>Recipe for Bistec Encebollado</head>
<h2>(Also known as Steak and Onions)</h2>

<p>Bistec Encebollado is a classic Puerto Rican dish. It is considered a very typical lunch or dinner recipe. In most Latin American countries, Spanish onions tend to have a sweeter flavor than many other onions that  help to balance out the vinegar, garlic, and oregano, that you'll be using in this recipe. On the stove top, I like to cook my steak well done, while some would say that is a travesty, however, for this dish cooking the steak well done helps to keep the moisture locked in while in the slow cooker, ensuring a very tender piece of meat.

<h3> Here are the ingredients you are going to need:</h3>

<ul> 2 pounds of flank steak</ul>
<ul> 2 Spanish onions, sliced</ul>
<ul> salt</ul>
<ul> pepper</ul>
<ul> 2 garlic cloves</ul>
<ul> 1/4 cup of red wine vinegar</ul>
<ul> 1 cup of beef broth</ul>
<ul> 2 teaspoons of oregano</ul>
<ul> 1 tablespoon of cumin</ul>


</ol> <h4>Now, let's get cooking! :</h4>
  
  <li>Slice the steak into long thin strips and place them into the slow cooker. Season the steak with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
<li>Then, cover the steak with sliced onions and minced garlic.</li>
<li>In a small bowl mix together the vinegar, beef broth, oregano, and cumin. Then pour over the steak and onions.</li>
<li>Set your slow cooker to low and cook for 8 hours.</li>
<li> Once your steak is tender, turn off the slow cooker and serve with white rice and sliced avocado.</li>
</ol>

<h5>A little variation tip:</h5>

<ol>

<li>To make this on a stove top, mix together red wine vinegar, 1/2 cup of beef broth, oregano, cumin, and garlic. Place the steak in the marinade, making sure it is completely coated. Cover and place in the refrigerator for about 8 hours. </li>

<li> After marinating, heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a skillet and saut√© onions for about 3 to 4 minutes. Pour the other 1/2 cup of beef broth into the pan and let the onions cook, absorbing the broth for another 7 to 10 minutes.</li>

<li>Then remove the onions from the pan, and in the same pan cook the steak to your preferred temperature. Then serve and enjoy!</li>
