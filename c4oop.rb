THIS EXERCISE IS NOT REQUIRED, BUT ENCOURAGED SO THAT YOU CAN EXPAND YOUR BRAIN.

Your job is to create Connect Four in Ruby (like the previous bonus exercise), but this time using classes and object oriented principles to structure your code.

Ask yourself the following questions before getting started - what are the different classes you would make here? What are the instance variables? What are the instance methods?
