#We want you to attempt and submit a solution for the challenge exercise. 

#It's okay if the solution isn't correct (the problem is quite difficult), 
but it's important to try such difficult problems to stretch your brain! The Holy Grail Layout refers to a website that has a header, three equal

 difficult to achieve this layout without a great deal of workarounds and hacks.

#Read this article to understand more about the problem and one specific solution: http://alistapart.com/article/holygrail. 
Then create a JSFiddle to implement their solution and post the link. More recently there are additions to CSS that allows for people to create 
this layout in a simpler way. Read this page to see a solution using flexbox, a new CSS property: https://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/demos/holy-grail/. 
Then create a JSFiddle to implement a flexbox-based solution and post the link.
